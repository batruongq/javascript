## BIG PRACTICE (5 DAYS)

### Targets:

- Understand & apply knowledge HTML/CSS/JavaScript (with ES6 syntax).
- Understanding & apply MVC (or any MV model or module concept) (**optional**)
- DOM manipulation, form validation.
- Understand how asynchronous code works & apply in practice (API call or any place we can mock API in code).
- Get familiar with DevTools (e.g Google Chrome DevTools) for debugging issues (breakpoint, log, etc..).
- Deploy to the hosting (with help from supporter) (**optional**)

### OPEN QUESTIONS

- What's the difference between Truthy/Falsy vs true/false in JavaScript? Why should we understand **Truthy/Falsy** in the JS world?
- How do you understand the **callback function?** List some cases we should use callback function.
- How many types of **variable scopes?** List some cases we should use this variable scope instead of others. Why should we understand scope?
- What is **Type Coercion?** What do you think Type Coercion will help?
- What is short-circuit evaluation?
- What are differences between **values & references?** Any potential issue/bug can occur you can see with reference? Please write down a simple example.
- What is pure function? List out the benefits of pure function, and what are you understanding about side effects.
- Pros and cons of **mutable and immutable.** The array methods (as map, push, pop..) belong to which one?
- What problem do **Object destructuring**, and Spread operators resolve?
- What problem does asynchronous resolve? What's the difference between **Promise and Async/Await** (Compare on chaining asynchronous call, code execution order & handle error syntax)? Is there any relationship you think between promise & async await?
- List some cases you would choose the arrow function instead of the regular function and vice versa?
